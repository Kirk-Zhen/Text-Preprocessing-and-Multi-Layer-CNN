### Please Check the report for detailed information about this project

### Notice:
* Before you execute `.py` and `.ipynb` files, please make sure that the file path in the code is correct.
* The `.py` and `.ipynb` for MLP and Naive Bayes automatically train the model with Text-cleaning, TFIDF and N-gram pre-processing method.
* The `.py` and `.ipynb` for Multi-Channel CNN automatically train the model with Text-cleaning and N-gram pre-processing method.
* It would be better to run `.ipynb` on Google Colab with GPU acceleration, it's much more faster.

### Files:
* Files in `py` folder are `.py` python program for this project
* Files in `notebook` folder are `.ipynb` Jupiter Notebook program for this project
* Raw data can be accessed at http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
