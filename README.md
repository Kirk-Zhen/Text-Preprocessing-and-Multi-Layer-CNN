### Dependencies:
|||
|:---|:---|
|numpy|1.17.4
|scikit-learn|0.22.0
|pandas|0.25.3
|scipy|1.3.1

### Notice:
* Before you execute `.py` and `.ipynb` files, please make sure that the file path in the code is correct.
* The `.py` and `.ipynb` for MLP and Naive Bayes automatically train the model with Text-cleaning, TFIDF and N-gram pre-processing method.
* The `.py` and `.ipynb` for Multi-Channel CNN automatically train the model with Text-cleaning and N-gram pre-processing method.
* It would be better to run `.ipynb` on Google Colab with GPU acceleration, it's much more faster.

### Files:
* Files in `py` folder are `.py` python program for this project
* Files in `notebook` folder are `.ipynb` Jupiter Notebook program for this project
* Files in `data` folder contains the `.csv` raw data for this project
* `report.pdf` is the paper report for this project
